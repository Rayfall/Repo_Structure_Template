# Overview
> Describe the motivation for the project, give a brief statement about the goals to hit, and the possible solutions this project can solve.

Keep track of all material that goes into the project here. Any assets or inspiration resources.

List current planning mode:

Show the 5 modes of Design Thinking: 

## Empathize
> Understand other peoples' experiences deeply and meaningfully. Empathy is the foundation of a human-centered design process.

Describe the empathy side of the project, what has been observed to prompt this project?
- List a few observations.

Has there been any studies conducted or research done?
- List a few points.

What examples are closely related to this project and what was the experience?
- Describe experiences of those examples.

## Define
> Unpack and synthesize your empathy findings into compelling needs and insights, and scope a specific meaningful challenge.

Usually this statement comes with a "How Might We..." approach. Define the project problem statement here and any resources or research findings that can back up the claim.

## Ideate
> Focus on generating solution ideas.

Start listing out all the possible solutions of ways to write the project. Coding is a very open space with many techniques to perform the same operations. Write out the obvious ideas and continue from there.

## Prototype
> Get the ideas and explorations out of the mind and into the physical/digital world.

Build some rough prototypes, maybe use places like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) to test things out before creating a repo and link the examples here for people to test and interact.

## Test
> Place low-resolution artifacts in the appropriate context of the user's life.

Now we can move to the repo section and start the application. With code examples and resolutions, making the project should be much easier now. This process should provide a learning opportunity about how far the project has come and test for the things that will refine your solutions and make them better.
